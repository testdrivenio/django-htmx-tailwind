# Rapid Prototyping with Django, htmx, and Tailwind CSS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up Django with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The goal of both htmx and Tailwind is to simplify modern web development so you can design and enable interactivity without ever leaving the comfort and ease of HTML. We'll also look at how to use [Django Compressor](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to bundle and minify static assets in a Django app.

## htmx

[htmx](https://htmx.org/) is a library that allows you to access modern browser features like AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly from HTML, rather than using JavaScript. It allows you to build user interfaces quickly directly in markup.

htmx extends several features already built into the browser, like making HTTP requests and responding to events. For example, rather than only being able to make GET and POST requests via `a` and `form` elements, you can use HTML attributes to send GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests on any HTML element:

```html
<button hx-delete="/user/1">Delete</button>
```

You can also update parts of a page to create a Single-page Application (SPA):

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="mjhea0" data-slug-hash="RwoJYyx" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="RwoJYyx">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/mjhea0/pen/RwoJYyx">
  RwoJYyx</a> by Michael Herman (<a href="https://codepen.io/mjhea0">@mjhea0</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p></p>

[CodePen link](https://codepen.io/mjhea0/pen/RwoJYyx)

Open the network tab in browser's dev tools. When the button is clicked, an XHR request is sent to the `https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?format=txt&safe-mode` endpoint. The response is then appended to the `p` element with an `id` of output.

> For more examples, check out the [UI Examples](https://htmx.org/examples/) page from the official htmx docs.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

1. *Developer productivity*: You can build modern user interfaces without touching JavaScript. For more on this, check out [An SPA Alternative](https://htmx.org/essays/spa-alternative/).
1. *Packs a punch*: The library itself is small (~9k min.gz'd), dependency-free, and [extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions/).

**Cons**:

1. *Library maturity*: Since the library is quite new, documentation and example implementations are sparse.
1. *Size of data transferred*: Typically, SPA frameworks (like React and Vue) work by passing data back and forth between the client and server in JSON format. The data received is then rendered by the client. htmx, on the other hand, receives the rendered HTML from the server, and it replaces the target element with the response. The HTML in rendered format is typically larger in terms of size than a JSON response.

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a "utility-first" CSS framework. Rather than shipping pre-built components (which frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) specialize in), it provides building blocks in the form of utility classes that enable one to create layouts and designs quickly and easily.

For example, take the following HTML and CSS:

```html
<style>
.hello {
  height: 5px;
  width: 10px;
  background: gray;
  border-width: 1px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 5px;
}
</style>

<div class="hello">Hello World</div>
```

This can be implemented with Tailwind like so:

```html
<div class="h-1 w-2 bg-gray-600 border rounded-sm p-1">Hello World</div>
```

Check out the [CSS Tailwind Converter](https://tailwind-converter.netlify.app/) to convert raw CSS over to the equivalent utility classes in Tailwind. Compare the results.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

1. *Highly customizable*: Although Tailwind comes with pre-built classes, they can be overwritten using the *tailwind.config.js* file.
1. *Optimization*: [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/), which we'll look at shortly, can remove all unused CSS classes from the Tailwind CSS file, reducing the size of the CSS bundle.
1. *Dark mode*: It's effortless to implement [dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) -- i.e., `<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">`.

**Cons**:

1. *Components*: Tailwind does not provide any official pre-built components like buttons, cards, nav bars, and so forth. Components have to be created from scratch. There are a few community-driven resources for components like [Tailwind CSS Components](https://tailwindcomponents.com/) and [Tailwind Toolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/), to name a few.
1. *CSS is inline*: This couples content and design, which increases the page size and clutters the HTML.

## Django Compressor

[Django Compressor](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an extension designed for managing (compressing/caching) static assets in a Django application. With it, you create a simple asset pipeline for:

1. Compiling [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to CSS stylesheets
1. Combining and minifying multiple CSS and JavaScript files down to a single file for each
1. Creating asset bundles for use in your templates

With that, let's look at how to work with each of the above projects in Django!

## Project Setup

To start, create a new folder for our project, create and activate a new virtual environment, and install Django along with Django Compressor:

```bash
$ mkdir django-htmx-tailwind && cd django-htmx-tailwind
$ python3.9 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv)$

(venv)$ pip install Django==3.1.7 django-compressor==2.4
```

Next, let's install Tailwind CSS, [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), and [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
$ npm install tailwindcss postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```

Additional tools:

- PostCSS - a tool used by Tailwind for preprocessing CSS
- Autoprefixer - a PostCSS plugin that automatically transforms CSS to support different browsers
- PurgeCSS - removes unused CSS

Next, create a new Django project and a `todos` app:

```bash
(venv)$ django-admin startproject config .
(venv)$ python manage.py startapp todos
```

Add the apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in *config/settings.py*:

```python
# config/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'todos',  # new
    'compressor',  # new
]
```

Create a "templates" folder in the root of your project. Then, update the `TEMPLATES` settings like so:

```python
# config/settings.py

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        "DIRS": [BASE_DIR / "templates"], # new
        ...
    },
]
```

Next, we need to create a new filter for Django Compressor to work with PurgeCSS in *todos/admin.py*:

```python
# todos/admin.py

from compressor.filters import CompilerFilter


class PostCSSFilter(CompilerFilter):
    command = "postcss"
```

Here, we created a new filter that runs the `postcss` command. The input and output locations will be detected automatically.

For the above filter to work, we need to add some configuration to the *config/settings.py*:

```python
# config/settings.py

COMPRESS_FILTERS = {'css': ['todos.admin.PostCSSFilter']}

COMPRESS_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static'

COMPRESS_ENABLED = True

STATICFILES_FINDERS = ('compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',)
```

Notes:

1. [COMPRESS_FILTERS](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/settings/#django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_FILTERS) defines which filters to use for compressing static assets.
1. [COMPRESS_ROOT](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/settings/#django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_ROOT) defines the absolute location from where the files to be compressed are read from and the compressed files are written to.
1. [COMPRESS_ENABLED](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/settings/#django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_ENABLED) boolean to determine whether compression will happen. It defaults to the opposite value of `DEBUG`.
1. [STATICFILES_FINDERS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATICFILES_FINDERS) must include Django Compressorâ€™s file finder when `django.contrib.staticfiles` is installed.

With that, we now have a Django Compressor filter configured to run the `postcss` command. Behind the scenes, PostCSS runs like so using a Python subprocess:

```bash
$ postcss {infile} -o {outfile}
```

When the filter is applied, `infile` will come from the template while `outfile` will be written, by [default](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/settings/?#django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_OUTPUT_DIR), to the "CACHE" folder.

> Since we set `COMPRESS_ROOT` to "static", the above-mentioned `infile` and `outfile` reside in the "static" folder.

With that, let's set up Tailwind and PostCSS.

Start by creating a Tailwind config file:

```bash
$ npx tailwind init
```

This should generate a *tailwind.config.js* file. All Tailwind customizations go into this file.

Next, add a *postcss.config.js* file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = (ctx) => ({
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss')(path.resolve(__dirname, 'tailwind.config.js')),
    require('autoprefixer'),
    process.env.DJANGO_PROD === 'production' && require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')({
      content: [
        path.resolve(__dirname, 'templates/**/*.html')
      ],
      defaultExtractor: content => content.match(/[A-Za-z0-9-_:/]+/g) || []
    })
  ],
});
```

Add the following to the *static/src/main.css*:

```css
/* static/src/main.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Here, we defined all the `base`, `components`, and `utilities` classes from Tailwind CSS. PostCSS will build all the classes into the target location.

That's it. You now have Django Compressor, Tailwind, and PostCSS setup. Next, we'll look at how to serve up an *index.html* file to see the CSS in action.

## Simple Example

Update the *todos/views.py* file like so:

```python
# todos/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render


def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')
```

Add the view to *todos/urls.py*:

```python
# todos/urls.py

from django.urls import path

from .views import index

urlpatterns = [
    path('', index, name='index'),
]
```

Then, add `todos.urls` to *config/urls.py*:

```python
# config/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('todos.urls')), # new
]
```

Add a *_base.html* file to "templates":

```html
<!-- templates/_base.html -->

{% load compress %}
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Django + HTMX + TailwindCSS</title>


    {% compress css %}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'src/main.css' %}">
    {% endcompress %}

  </head>
  <body class="bg-blue-100">
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock content %}
  </body>
</html>
```

Notes:

1. `{% load compress %}` imports all the required tags to work with Django Compressor.
1. `{% load static %}` loads static files into the template.
1. `{% compress css %}` applies the appropriate filters to the *static/src/main.css* file. Take note of the `css` key. This tells Django Compressor to apply all CSS filters, which we defined in the settings: `COMPRESS_FILTERS = {'css': ['todos.admin.PostCSSFilter']}`.

Also, we added some color to the HTML body via `<body class="bg-blue-100">`. `bg-blue-100` is used to change the [background color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color) to light blue.

Add an *index.html* file:


```html
<!-- templates/index.html -->

{% extends "_base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
{% endblock content %}
```

Apply the migrations and run the development server:

```sh
(venv)$ python manage.py migrate
(venv)$ python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to see the results. Also take note of the generated file in the "static/CACHE/css" folder.

> If you get a `Program file not found: postcss`, try installing PostCSS globally: `npm install --global postcss postcss-cli`.

With Tailwind configured, let's add htmx into the mix and build a live search that displays results as you type.

## Live Search Example

Rather than fetching the htmx library from a CDN, let's download it and use Django Compressor to bundle it.

Download the library from [https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.2.1/dist/htmx.js](https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.2.1/dist/htmx.js) and save it to *static/src/htmx.js*.

So that we have some data to work with, save [https://github.com/testdrivenio/django-htmx-tailwind/blob/master/todos/apps.py](https://github.com/testdrivenio/django-htmx-tailwind/blob/master/todos/apps.py) to a new file called *todos/todo.py*.

Now, add the view to implement the search functionality to *todos/views.py*:

```python
# todos/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methods  # new

from .todo import todos  # new


def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html', {'todos': []}) # modified


# new
@require_http_methods(['POST'])
def search(request):
    res_todos = []
    search = request.POST['search']
    if len(search) == 0:
        return render(request, 'todo.html', {'todos': []})
    for i in todos:
        if search in i['title']:
            res_todos.append(i)
    return render(request, 'todo.html', {'todos': res_todos})
```

We added a new view, `search`, that searches for the todos and renders the *todo.html* template with all the results.

 Add the newly created view to *todos/urls.py*:

```python
# todos/urls.py

from django.urls import path

from .views import index, search  # modified

urlpatterns = [
    path('', index, name='index'),
    path('search/', search, name='search'),  # new
]
```

Next, add the new asset to the *_base.html* file:

```html
<!-- templates/base.html -->

{% load compress %}
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Django + HTMX + TailwindCSS</title>


    {% compress css %}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'src/main.css' %}">
    {% endcompress %}

  </head>
  <body class="bg-blue-100">
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock content %}

    <!-- new -->
    {% compress js %}
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'src/htmx.js' %}"></script>
    {% endcompress %}
    <script>
      document.body.addEventListener('htmx:configRequest', (event) => {
        event.detail.headers['X-CSRFToken'] = '{{ csrf_token }}';
      })
    </script>

  </body>
</html>
```

We loaded the htmx library using the `{% compress js %}` tag. Although we didn't define a `js` key in the `COMPRESS_FILTERS` setting --

```python
COMPRESS_FILTERS = {'css': ['todos.admin.PostCSSFilter']}
```

-- JSMinFilter (which applies [rjsmin](https://pypi.org/project/rjsmin/)) is configured by [default](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/settings/#django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_FILTERS). So, this will minify *src/htmx.js* and serve it from the "static/CACHE" folder.

We also added the following script:

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:configRequest', (event) => {
  event.detail.headers['X-CSRFToken'] = '{{ csrf_token }}';
})
```

This event listener adds the CSRF token to the request header when a .

We'll add the ability to search based on the title of each todo.

Update the *index.html* file like so:

```html
<!-- templates/index.html -->
{% extends "_base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <div class="w-small w-2/3 mx-auto py-10 text-gray-600">
    <input
      type="text"
      name="search"
      hx-post="/search/"
      hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:250ms"
      hx-indicator=".htmx-indicator"
      hx-target="#todo-results"
      placeholder="Search"
      class="bg-white h-10 px-5 pr-10 rounded-full text-2xl focus:outline-none"
    >
    <span class="htmx-indicator">Searching...</span>
  </div>
  <table class="border-collapse w-small w-2/3 mx-auto">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="p-3 font-bold uppercase bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 border border-gray-300 hidden lg:table-cell">#</th>
        <th class="p-3 font-bold uppercase bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 border border-gray-300 hidden lg:table-cell">Title</th>
        <th class="p-3 font-bold uppercase bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 border border-gray-300 hidden lg:table-cell">Completed</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody id="todo-results">
      {% include "todo.html" %}
    </tbody>
  </table>
{% endblock content %}
```

Let's take a moment to look at the attributes defined from htmx:

```html
<input
  type="text"
  name="search"
  hx-post="/search/"
  hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:250ms"
  hx-indicator=".htmx-indicator"
  hx-target="#todo-results"
  placeholder="Search"
  class="bg-white h-10 px-5 pr-10 rounded-full text-2xl focus:outline-none"
>
```

1. The input sends a POST request to the `/search` endpoint.
1. The request is triggered via a [keyup event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keyup_event) with a delay of 250ms. So if a new keyup event is entered before 250ms has elapsed after the last keyup, the request is not triggered.
1. The HTML response from the request is then displayed in the `#todo-results` element.
1. We also have an indicator, a loading element that appears after the request is sent and disappears after the response comes back.

Add the *templates/todo.html* file:

```html
<!-- templates/todo.html -->

{% for todo in todos %}
  <tr
    class="bg-white lg:hover:bg-gray-100 flex lg:table-row flex-row lg:flex-row flex-wrap lg:flex-no-wrap mb-10 lg:mb-0">
    <td class="w-full lg:w-auto p-3 text-gray-800 text-center border border-b block lg:table-cell relative lg:static">
      {{todo.id}}
    </td>
    <td class="w-full lg:w-auto p-3 text-gray-800 text-center border border-b block lg:table-cell relative lg:static">
      {{todo.title}}
    </td>
    <td class="w-full lg:w-auto p-3 text-gray-800 text-center border border-b block lg:table-cell relative lg:static">
      {% if todo.completed %}
        <span class="rounded bg-green-400 py-1 px-3 text-xs font-bold">Yes</span>
      {% else %}
        <span class="rounded bg-red-400 py-1 px-3 text-xs font-bold">No</span>
      {% endif %}
    </td>
  </tr>
{% endfor %}
```

This file renders the todos that match our search query.

Run the application using `python manage.py runserver` and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) again to test it out

<img data-src="/static/images/blog/flask-htmx-tailwind/demo.gif"  loading="lazy" class="lazyload" style="max-width:100%" alt="demo">

## Removing unwanted CSS

The size of the generated CSS file in "static/CACHE/css" is roughly 3.9MB because we generated the whole Tailwind CSS file. That said, since we are only using a few classes for styling, we can remove unused CSS via [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/).

We already configured it earlier in *postcss.config.js*:

```javascript
process.env.DJANGO_PROD === 'production' && require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')({
  content: [
    path.resolve(__dirname, 'templates/**/*.html')
  ],
  defaultExtractor: content => content.match(/[A-Za-z0-9-_:/]+/g) || []
})
```

So, when `DJANGO_PROD` is 'production', PurgeCSS wil walk through all the HTML files in the templates folder and remove unused CSS.

To test, fist set the environment variable:

```bash
(venv)$ export DJANGO_PROD=production # for Linux

(venv)$ set DJANGO_PROD=production # for windows
```

Start the app, navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Then, inspect the newly created file in "static/CACHE/css". It should now only be 12KB! Nice. Ensure the app still works before moving on.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we looked at how to:

- Set up Django Compressor and Tailwind CSS
- Build a live search app using Django, TailwindCSS, and htmx
- Remove unused CSS with PurgeCSS

htmx can render elements without reloading the page. Most importantly, you can achieve this without writing any JavaScript. Although this reduces the amount of work required on the client-side, the data sent from the sever can be higher since it's sending rendered HTML.

Serving up partial HTML templates like this was popular in the early 2000s. htmx provides a modern twist to this approach. In general, serving up partial templates is becoming popular again due to how complex frameworks like React and Vue are. You can add websockets into the mix to deliver realtime changes as well. This same approach is used by the famous [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html). You can read more about HTML over websockets in [The Future of Web Software Is HTML-over-WebSockets](https://alistapart.com/article/the-future-of-web-software-is-html-over-websockets/).

The library is still young, but the future looks very bright.

Tailwind is a powerful CSS framework that focuses on developer productivity. Although this tutorial didn't touch on it, Tailwind is highly customizeable. Take a look at the following resources for more:

- [Tailwind CSS Customization](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration)
- [The complete guide to customizing a Tailwind CSS theme](https://pinegrow.com/tutorials/customizing-a-tailwind-css-theme/)
- [Customize the Tailwind Design System](https://egghead.io/lessons/tailwind-customize-the-tailwind-design-system)
- [A gentle guide to customization in Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/developeraspire/a-gentle-guide-to-customization-in-tailwindcss-9cp)

When using Django, be sure to couple both htmx and Tailwind with Django Compressor to simplify static asset management.

The full code can be found in the [django-htmx-tailwind](https://github.com/testdrivenio/django-htmx-tailwind) repository.
